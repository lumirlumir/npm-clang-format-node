    ```

1. Move to the `npm-clang-format-node` directory.

    ```bash
    cd npm-clang-format-node
    ```

1. Install npm packages. ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is required.)

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Edit codes.

1. Create `my-branch` branch.

### `node:` namespace

The `node:` namespace prefix for built-in modules was introduced in Node.js `14.18.0` and `16.0.0`. While using it is recommended for new projects, we use different approaches in this project:

- For regular application code, use standard imports without the `node:` prefix for broader compatibility:

  ```js
  // Standard import (works in all Node.js versions)
  const fs = require('fs');
  ```

- For test files (`.test.js`) that use the `node:test` runner, you may use the `node:` prefix:

  ```js
  // node: prefix allowed in test files
  const fs = require('node:fs');
  ```

This approach helps maintain compatibility across Node.js versions while allowing modern syntax in test environments where version constraints are less critical.
